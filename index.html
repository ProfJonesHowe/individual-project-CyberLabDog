<H2> About my experiace and interpitation </H2>
<p>This is my webpage about my first time playing Deus Ex without going back and doing 100% completion.
The game is about a cyborg agent working for a globle govermnt the was in kahoots all the elites while a 
world wild plage is happening. One of the groups split off saying they don't need the rest and all the secret orgenizations are now fighting. 
The game is based on many conspiracies of the time to create a new world order is the short version with your decisons impacting the world.</p>

<p>I quit liked it and how open the game is with its desitions, there are bugs and it is on the older side but the story holds up quit well.
It does have replayability and does have decent deadpan/dark humer. The games charecter modifications is okay but some like for aiming is bad,
the whole gun play is quite bad pushing to stealt which is decent.</p>
